📊 Customer Retention & Churn Analysis Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer churn and retention patterns using subscription-based business data. The objective is to identify why customers leave, which customer segments are most at risk, and how retention strategies can improve revenue stability.

The analysis simulates real-world SaaS and subscription analytics workflows where reducing churn directly improves business growth and profitability.

The dashboard was built using Power BI, with feature engineering and cohort analysis performed using Microsoft Excel.

🎯 Business Objectives

This project addresses critical business questions such as:

Why are customers leaving the platform?

Which customer segments have the highest churn risk?

When during the customer lifecycle does churn occur most?

How does churn impact revenue?

What strategies can improve customer retention?
